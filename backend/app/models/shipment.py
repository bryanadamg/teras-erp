class Shipment(Base):
    """One Surat Jalan = one loading-deck handover, grouping 1..n pick lists.

    The outbound chain mirrors standard WMS practice and each tier is a different
    person doing a different job:

        PackingOrder  -> pack bulk FG into cartons          (packer)
        PickList      -> pull named cartons for an SO       (picker)
        Shipment      -> stage on the deck, check, hand over (loader + checker)

    A pick list is an internal instruction and ends at PICKED. The Surat Jalan is
    the external, signed, legally-kept document, and the facts it carries — SJ
    number, vehicle, driver, delivery date — are loading-deck facts that do not
    exist while picking. Keeping them on PickList meant the picker typed their own
    delivery note and then confirmed their own dispatch; the four-eyes gate this
    entity exists for was unenforceable.

    Status flow: DRAFT -> STAGED -> VERIFIED -> DISPATCHED (or CANCELLED).
      DRAFT      pick lists being gathered onto the deck
      STAGED     goods physically on the loading deck, Surat Jalan printed
      VERIFIED   a *second* person counted the cartons against that printout
      DISPATCHED goods issue posted, truck gone

    Staging deliberately moves no stock. This plant nets material availability
    location-agnostically (see CLAUDE.md), so shunting cartons into a "deck" bin
    would write ledger rows that change nothing anyone reads, and would have to be
    unwound on every cancel. Stock leaves once, at goods issue.

    Scope: one shipment carries one customer, because one Surat Jalan addresses one
    `Kepada Yth`. A truck doing several drops is several shipments.
