"""Explosion-time MRP netting (Option A).

When a Production Run or a nested MO is created, each sub-assembly's gross
requirement is netted against *net-free* available stock BEFORE its component
MO is created. Fully-covered components are skipped (and their own sub-tree is
NOT exploded); partially-covered components are resized to the shortfall.

    net_free(item, variant, location)
        = on_hand     -- StockBalance, rolled up across the location's leaf spots
        + incoming    -- outstanding output of OTHER open MOs producing the item,
                         excluding COMMITTED output (see below)
        - required    -- outstanding component demand of OTHER open MOs

Committed-supply rule: a root MO (not a shared component, no parent) that is
linked to a sales order — directly via MO.sales_order_id or through its
Production Run — has its output promised to that order. It is NOT free supply
and never nets away a new, distinct order for the same item. Shared-component
and child MOs stay in supply (their output is balanced by the consuming MOs'
component demand), as do uncommitted root MOs (stock-builds / greige
stockpiling), whose output deliberately covers future demand.

"OTHER" excludes the unit being planned (the current Production Run, or the
current root MO) so a run never nets against its own freshly-created demand —
that demand IS the gross requirement we are netting.

The availability ledger is MUTABLE: every node that consumes free stock
decrements the running balance, so two sibling demands (or two consolidated
component keys) cannot both claim the same physical stock.

Scope notes (Tier 1):
- Production Run root finished goods ARE netted (same SKIP/RESIZE/MAKE rule as
  components), unless the PR's BOM entry sets force_create=True — used to
  deliberately keep producing an item that already carries stock (e.g. greige
  stockpiling). A single ad-hoc MO created via POST /manufacturing-orders is
  make-to-order and its root is still never netted; only its descendants are.
- Cross-location supply (transfer instead of make) is NOT modelled here; netting
  is scoped to each node's planned source location and its leaf spots.
- Safety stock and BOM tolerance % are ignored (gross = qty x percentage / 100);
  this mirrors the qty an MO is actually sized at.
- net_free is a creation-time snapshot for COMPONENTS: no reservation row is
  written for them, so re-running planning after stock moves requires a re-net.
  Root finished goods netted for a SALES-ORDER-linked run are the exception —
  see the reserved term below.

Reserved term: a root FG requirement covered from stock produces no MO, so before
`stock_reservations` existed the coverage left no trace anywhere and the NEXT
sales order netted the same physical pile away again (both orders planned short).
`POST /production-runs` now writes a `StockReservation` for the covered qty, and
that qty is subtracted here exactly like MO component demand. It is tracked in a
separate `_reserved` bucket purely so the creation preview can tell the planner
"400 is on hand but promised to SO-00123" rather than blaming an MO.

A reservation counts only while its row is ACTIVE and its sales order is still
OPEN (`OPEN_SO_STATUSES`). Both conditions matter: the status filter means a
SENT/DELIVERED/CANCELLED order releases its hold even if the release write never
ran, so a stale row can never permanently strand stock.
