It runs a recursive material coverage analysis against open Manufacturing Orders to calculate Production Yield (what percentage of open orders can be started with current stock) and Delivery Readiness (what percentage of open SO lines have sufficient finished goods or production in progress to fulfil). Low-stock and overdue items are listed with direct links.',

Four views share one date range: Per Machine and Per Group roll output up the work-centre tree; Per Work Order is the result sheet for a finished order (target, hasil, QC reject, reject % of hasil) with a "Completed WOs only" filter; Packing reports the same columns per packing order, since packing rejects have no machine to peg to. Expanding any row lists its reject events — quantity, reason, who rejected it, and the defect store the scrap was moved into. Everything exports to CSV.',
